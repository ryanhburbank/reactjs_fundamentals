This is my implementatin of Github Battle,
based on lessons from the ReactJS fundamentals course
taught by Tyler Mcginnis

__Resources__:
* [React.js Course](http://www.reactjsprogram.com/)
* [React.js Fundamentals Github Repo](https://github.com/ReactjsProgram/React-Fundamentals)

__To Use__:
- 1. Clone repo
- 2. install node (*if necessary*)
- 3. npm install
- 4. npm run start (this will start the server)
- 5. go to appropriate port (8080 by default)
- 6. enjoy
*&ast note: if you have an Github API key, go to app/utils/githubHelpers.js to add it.  If not throttling may occur.*
